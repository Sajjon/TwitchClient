# Design choices
  1. Renamed `Info.plist` -> `TwitchClient-Info.plist` to more easily find it using `CMD + SHIFT + O` command since the project is using Pods and we have many `Info.plist` files.
  2. Renamed `Supporting Files` -> `SupportingFiles` since it is preferably to not use spaces in folders or file names
  3. Moved `AppDelegate` to `SupportingFiles`
